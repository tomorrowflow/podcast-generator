# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Enhance Internal Content Production Efficiency: Achieve a 50% reduction in time taken to produce audio content from text sources within 6 months of MVP deployment.
*   Strengthen Data Security & IP Protection: Maintain 0 instances of sensitive internal data exposure to external services related to podcast generation.
*   Increase Internal Knowledge Dissemination: Boost engagement with internal communications and training materials by creating an additional 2 hours of audio content per week, leading to a 20% increase in content consumption by relevant internal teams within 9 months.
*   User Adoption Rate: 75% of target internal content creators utilize the AI Podcast Generator at least once per month.
*   Content Generation Satisfaction: Achieve an average user satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 for generated podcast quality and ease of use.
*   Time Savings per Podcast: Average 30% reduction in time spent by users on podcast creation compared to manual methods.

## Background Context

This project addresses the inefficiencies and security risks associated with current internal audio content creation processes, particularly podcasts. Manual methods lead to slow turnaround times, and reliance on external cloud AI services poses significant threats to data privacy, intellectual property, and compliance due to sensitive internal data exposure. The AI Podcast Generator aims to resolve these issues by providing an on-premises, secure, and automated solution that transforms internal information into high-quality audio podcasts, ensuring data remains within the secure datacenter environment and boosting internal team productivity. This solution leverages open-source components like `podcastfy`, `Kyutai TTS`, `Whisper ASR Webservice`, and `Ollama`, deployed via Docker Compose on a gaming PC for MVP due to its GPU capabilities, ensuring full control over sensitive information and streamlined content production through a web application with `21st-dev/magic-mcp` components.
