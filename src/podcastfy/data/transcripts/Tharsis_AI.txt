<Person1> "Welcome to Podcastfy - your personal GenAI podcast! In this episode, we're diving deep into the world of AI, data science, and what the future holds for these rapidly evolving fields." </Person1>

<Person2> "It's fascinating stuff! We've seen such explosive growth in these areas, especially with tools like GPT becoming so prevalent. It feels like we're on the cusp of something huge, doesn't it?" </Person2>

<Person1> "Absolutely. And to guide us through this intricate landscape, we're tapping into a conversation with a true expert - Tharsis Souza. He's a computer scientist who's passionate about data-driven products, a Senior Vice President at Two Sigma Investments, and a lecturer at Columbia University. He's also deeply involved in mentoring up-and-coming talent in the field." </Person2>

<Person2> "Wow, he sounds incredibly accomplished. So, what insights did Tharsis share in this conversation?" </Person2>

<Person1> "Well, he dives into the idea of AGI - artificial general intelligence. You know, that concept of machines achieving human-level intelligence and beyond. He seems to believe that progress in AI will undeniably continue, but pinpointing exactly when a machine can fully replicate a human job is tricky." </Person1>

<Person2> "That makes sense. There are so many nuances to every job, even ones that seem straightforward. It's not just about processing information; it's about understanding context, emotions, and all those subtle things humans do." </Person2>

<Person1> "Right! And Tharsis points out that this is where things get really interesting. He talks about how AI, in its current form, is essentially mimicking human behavior. It's excellent at recognizing patterns and making predictions based on massive datasets, but true creativity, that spark of originality, is still a hurdle." </Person1>

<Person2> "So, how do we bridge that gap? How do we get AI to think outside the box, so to speak?" </Person2>

<Person1> "Tharsis highlights the importance of providing AI with a 'structured environment of reality' to play in, similar to how AI excels in games with defined rules and objectives. He even suggests that teaching AI to code and allowing it to see the consequences of its code could be a promising avenue." </Person1>

<Person2> "That's a fascinating thought! Allowing AI to experiment and learn in a controlled but dynamic environment like that could lead to some unexpected breakthroughs." </Person2>

<Person1> "Exactly! And while there's a ton of data available online, Tharsis emphasizes the need for more data on 'normal' human behavior, emotions, and thought processes. Basically, we need to teach AI how to be more human." </Person1>

<Person2> "It's like we're trying to create a digital version of ourselves, but without the instruction manual." </Person2>

<Person1> "In a way, yes! Tharsis also delves into the limitations of current AI models, like GPT. While these models are constantly being refined, he uses the analogy of GPT-3 being like a lizard brain and GPT-4 being akin to a cat's brain in terms of scale. We still have a long way to go before we reach the complexity of the human brain." </Person1>

<Person2> "So, if we're talking about exponential growth, are we headed towards a singularity? That point where AI surpasses human intelligence and things accelerate at an unimaginable pace?" </Person2>

<Person1> "That's the million-dollar question! Tharsis seems to believe that while we haven't hit an asymptote yet, there's no telling how things will unfold once we reach and surpass human-level intelligence. It could be a series of breakthroughs, new paradigms we haven't even conceived of yet." </Person1>

<Person2> "It's both exciting and a bit daunting, isn't it? Knowing that we're potentially on the verge of something so transformative." </Person2>

<Person1> "Absolutely. And that's the beauty of it! We're venturing into uncharted territory, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. It's a journey filled with endless possibilities and, of course, a healthy dose of the unknown." </Person1>

<Person2> "Thanks for breaking down these complex concepts for us. It's been an eye-opening look at the future of AI and data science. Until next time on Podcastfy!" </Person2>
