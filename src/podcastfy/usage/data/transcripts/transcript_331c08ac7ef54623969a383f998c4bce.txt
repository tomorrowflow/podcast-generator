<Person1>Welcome to PODCASTIFY - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast.  This is going to be a deep dive into, well, the fascinating world of Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. And not just the story itself, right?</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly. The context, the history, the journey of the autobiography itself. It's like a story within a story.</Person2>
<Person1>Absolutely! We're talking about a document that started as a personal letter to his son, William, in 1771, imagine that! Tucked away in Twyford, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's. A quiet retreat, meant for family eyes only.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, with no intention of it becoming this, um, this monumental piece of American literature. Quite the twist of fate.</Person2>
<Person1>Huh, a total twist. So he writes this first part, pretty informal, personal, gets up to 1731. Brings it back to Philly in '75. Then, poof, it vanishes during the Revolution.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? Vanishes completely?  I mean, talk about a historical cliffhanger! What happened next?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, twenty-three pages, pretty densely written, end up with Abel James. He sends a copy to Franklin in France, urging him, "Hey, finish this thing!"</Person1>
<Person2>Ah, so the story gets resurrected.  This is where it takes on a new life, almost literally.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, and Franklin picks it up again in Passy, 1784. Shifts the tone a bit, aiming it more towards younger readers, but gets interrupted, doesn't pick it back up until '88, back in Philly.</Person1>
<Person2>Makes sense. The man had a country to build.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly, he was a busy guy. So, he gets as far as 1757 with the narrative. Copies are sent to friends, one to Monsieur Le Veillard in Paris. Then, in 1791, a French edition pops up, a bit rough around the edges, not quite complete, translation a little clunky.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, the first edition, not in its original language. That's an odd historical footnote.</Person2>
<Person1>Absolutely! Now, the real manuscript goes on a wild ride. Franklin leaves everything to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, his literary executor. Young William, when he finally publishes his grandfather's works in 1817, he trades the original manuscript to Le Veillard's daughter for her dad's copy. Probably thought it was a cleaner version for printing.</Person1>
<Person2>So the original bounces around the Le Veillard family for decades.</Person2>
<Person1>Right.  Until 1867, when it gets sold to John Bigelow, US Minister to France. He sells it again to E. Dwight Church who's library eventually becomes part of Henry E. Huntington's collection.</Person1>
<Person2>Wow. So, it ends up in a vault on Fifth Avenue.</Person2>
<Person1>Yup. And here's the kicker. Bigelow realizes what everyone's been reading wasn't the real deal. Temple Franklin had taken some, uh, liberties.  Like, twelve hundred changes to the text! Bigelow publishes the accurate version in 1868, with the short fourth part that no one had seen before.</Person1>
<Person2>Incredible! A true testament to the twists and turns of literary history. And then it takes off, translated, reprinted countless times, a classic still read today. What a story!</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's autobiography, right? It's not just about his life, but how the story itself came to be.  It's fascinating!</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, like, he starts writing it as a letter to his son, William, super casual, but it evolves into this, um, this literary masterpiece, almost by accident.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally!  And the journey of that manuscript? Wild!  Passed around, lost, edited, mistranslated.  It's a miracle we have the real thing at all. Remember the grandson's "improvements?"</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, yeah? Twelve hundred changes!  Who knew? Talk about editorial overreach!  So, how does the young Franklin end up in London?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, there's this Governor Keith, right?  Total smooth talker, promises young Ben the world, a printing business in Philly, the whole nine yards.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, really?</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, encourages him to go to London, get supplies, set up shop. Even promises letters of credit, introductions to important people.</Person1>
<Person2>Sounds too good to be true. Almost like a, a fairy tale or something.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly!  So, Franklin sails off, full of hope, with his buddy Ralph, who's ditching his wife and kid, by the way,  but that's a whole other story. They arrive in London, expecting the red carpet treatment.</Person1>
<Person2>And?</Person2>
<Person1>Crickets.  No letters, no credit, nothing.  Keith totally ghosted him.  Turns out he's notorious for making empty promises.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, man!  Poor Franklin, completely stranded in London. What a betrayal!</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's in London, broke, right?  Living hand to mouth, sharing a room with Ralph, who's completely forgotten his family back home. Sounds like a recipe for disaster.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? Total mess.  And Franklin himself, uh, kind of forgets about Miss Read back in Philly. Doesn't write, no contact. Big regret later on, he says.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh?  Another erratum, as he calls it.  So, to make ends meet, he lands a job at Palmer's printing house. Not exactly glamorous, but it's work.</Person1>
<Person2>Right, and he's pretty diligent, but, uh, still blows a lot of his earnings with Ralph, going to plays, other amusements.  Typical young guys in a big city, I guess.</Person2>
<Person1>I suppose. He even writes a little philosophical piece, "Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity"â€”gets him noticed, but also a lecture from his boss. Another erratum, he says.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, interesting. Sounds like he's trying to find himself, intellectually, morally, all that.</Person2>
<Person1>Totally.  And he's devouring books. Makes a deal with a bookseller, Wilcox, to borrow anything he wants. No circulating libraries back then, so that's a big deal.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, that's cool.  So, he meets this surgeon, Lyons, gets introduced to some interesting characters, Dr. Mandeville, author of "Fable of the Bees," even gets a promise to meet Isaac Newton, although that never happens.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, too bad.  But he does meet Sir Hans Sloane, sells him an asbestos purse.  A little side hustle. And there's this whole thing with the milliner, Mrs. T....  Gets a little complicated.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? Complicated how?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, Ralph moves in with her, but things go south, he abandons her, takes off for the country, even steals Franklin's name for his teaching job!  Can you believe that?</Person1>
<Person2>No way! That's crazy! What a nerve.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's in London, no money, no prospects.  But he's determined to make something of himself, right?  And the way he goes about it? Pretty remarkable.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? How so?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, he cultivates this image of, like, the industrious young man. Dresses simply, avoids frivolous activities. You know, really playing the part.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, I see.  Like a, a self-made man before the term even existed.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly!  Even hauls paper through the streets on a wheelbarrow, just to show he's not above any kind of work.</Person1>
<Person2>Wow. That's dedication. So, this strategy actually works?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally!  Builds his credit, attracts customers.  Meanwhile, his former boss, Keimer, is, um, well, not doing so well.  Ends up selling his printing house and fleeing to Barbados.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? What a contrast! And Franklin? He, uh?</Person2>
<Person1>He's thriving.  Even Keimer's former apprentice, Harry, tries to compete, but, uh, he's more interested in living the high life than working hard. Follows Keimer to Barbados, ends up working for him.  Talk about a fall from grace!</Person1>
<Person2>That's wild! So, Franklin's got a clear field now. Except for?</Person2>
<Person1>Old man Bradford, yeah.  But he's not really a threat.  Complacent, doesn't hustle.  Although, he does have the post office, which gives him an edge with advertisements and news distribution. Franklin resents this, even resorts to bribing the riders to carry his paper.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm.  So, even Franklin has his, uh, less-than-perfect moments. What about his personal life?  Any developments?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, he's still boarding with the Godfreys, and Mrs. Godfrey tries to set him up with her niece.  Things get serious, but then, um, stall over the dowry.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  Money troubles again?</Person2>
<Person1>Sort of.  The Godfreys balk at providing the dowry Franklin asks for, claiming the printing business is too risky, citing Keimer and Harry as examples. Franklin's kind of insulted, breaks things off.</Person1>
<Person2>Ouch! That's gotta sting.  So, what happens next?</Person2>
<Person1>He starts thinking about marriage more seriously, looks around, but realizes printers aren't exactly considered great catches.  Then, he reconnects with Miss Read, remembers his, uh, "erratum" in London.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  So, they rekindle their romance? Even though she's, you know..</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, supposedly married.  But the husband's whereabouts are uncertain. There are rumors of his death, debts, the whole nine yards.  But they decide to take the plunge anyway, get married in 1730.</Person1>
<Person2>Wow, a bold move!  Does it work out?</Person2>
<Person1>Surprisingly, yes!  They're happy, she helps him with the business. A true partnership, he calls her a "faithful helpmate." He even corrects the erratum, as he puts it. A happy ending, at least for a while.  And around this time, he starts thinking about public projects, like libraries. First, a small one with his Junto group, sharing books, but that doesn't quite pan out.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? What goes wrong?</Person2>
<Person1>Lack of organization, mostly. So, he gets this idea for a public subscription library.  Fifty subscribers, forty shillings each, plus ten shillings a year.  Gets a charter, the whole shebang.  It becomes a huge success, a model for other libraries throughout the colonies.</Person1>
<Person2>That's amazing!  So, he's a printer, a publisher, a librarian. What else?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, he starts Poor Richard's Almanack in 1732, and that becomes wildly popular.  Uses it to share proverbs, practical advice, you know, promoting industry, frugality, all that good stuff.  Even collects them into a speech, gets reprinted everywhere, translated into French. A real phenomenon.</Person1>
<Person2>Incredible! So, he's really hitting his stride now.  Making a name for himself, impacting society. Quite the journey from that stranded young man in London.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's talking about his printing business, right?  He mentions sending a journeyman down to Charleston to set up a partnership.  One-third of the profits, pretty standard deal.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, but the guy's not great with accounting.  Typical printer, maybe? Focused on the craft, not the numbers.</Person2>
<Person1>Well, that's the thing, his widow takes over, right?  And she's amazing!  Born and bred in Holland, where, apparently, women learn accounting.  Who knew?</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? So, she turns the business around?  Like, really successful?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally! Raises her kids, buys the printing house from Franklin, sets up her son.  Franklin uses this as a, um, a plug for educating women in accounting.  More useful than music or dancing, he says.</Person1>
<Person2>I see.  Practical skills over, uh, accomplishments. Makes sense, especially for that time. What else?</Person2>
<Person1>Then there's this preacher, Hemphill, from Ireland.  Great speaker, draws huge crowds. But, uh, not so orthodox, according to the Presbyterians.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? So, they try to silence him?</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, big controversy.  Franklin writes pamphlets for him, defends him in the Gazette. Turns out Hemphill's sermons are, um, borrowed.  Lifted from British Reviews.</Person1>
<Person2>No way!  Plagiarism?  What does Franklin do?</Person2>
<Person1>Sticks by him! Says he'd rather have good sermons by others than bad ones by Hemphill. But the jig is up, Hemphill leaves town, Franklin quits the congregation.</Person1>
<Person2>Wow.  So, Franklin's learning languages, too? French, Italian, Spanish.</Person2>
<Person1>Yup, even gets back into Latin, surprised how much he remembers. Uses chess to learn Italian, by the way.  Victor sets a language task for the loser. Pretty clever!</Person1>
<Person2>That's cool!  So, he visits Boston after ten years, sees his brother in Newport.  And they reconcile, after their earlier falling out.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, brother's not well, asks Franklin to take his son, train him as a printer.  Which he does, making amends for leaving him earlier. And then he loses his own son, to smallpox.  A real tragedy.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, that's awful!  He regrets not inoculating him.  A warning to other parents, he says.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's elected to the House, right? And for ten years straight!  Never even campaigned.  Pretty impressive. And then, his son gets appointed clerk. Nepotism, maybe?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, it was a different time.  Anyway, there's this treaty with the Indians at Carlisle. Franklin's sent as a commissioner.  And he has this, um, interesting approach to keeping things orderly.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh? The rum strategy?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah! No liquor during negotiations, but free-flowing rum afterward. Keeps the peace, gets the treaty signed.  Although, the aftermath sounds like, uh, a scene from Dante.</Person2>
<Person1>A bonfire, drunken brawls, the whole nine yards.  And then they demand more rum!  Unbelievable.  But the Indian orator's excuse? Classic. The Great Spirit made rum for Indians to get drunk with.  What can you say?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah?  Franklin even muses about, uh, Providence using rum to clear the way for settlers. A bit dark, maybe. Then there's this whole thing with Dr. Bond and the hospital.</Person2>
<Person1>The first hospital in Philly!  Bond struggles to get funding, goes to Franklin, who's already a, a civic leader, right?  Franklin gets the word out, uses the newspapers, his usual tactic.</Person1>
<Person2>Right.  And he pulls this clever maneuver with the Assembly. Gets them to pledge matching funds if the public raises a certain amount.  Uses that pledge to boost donations, gets the hospital built.  Pretty ingenious!</Person2>
<Person1>And then there's Reverend Tennent and the new meeting house. Franklin's reluctant to ask for more donations, gives Tennent some, uh, strategic advice instead.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  "Ask everyone," he says.  Even those you think will say no. Works like a charm!  Tennent gets his meeting house.  Franklin, the master strategist, even for other people's projects.</Person2>
<Person1>Then, paving the streets! Starts with the Jersey Market, sees people trudging through mud, gets that strip paved.  But it just gets muddy again.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah?  So, he hires a poor woman to sweep, gets the neighbors to chip in.  Small expense, big impact!  Leads to the whole city getting paved and lit.</Person2>
<Person1>And the street lamps!  Improves on the London design, makes them more efficient, less smoky, easier to clean.  Even has this idea for street sweeping in London, shares it with Dr. Fothergill.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  Observes a poor woman sweeping, realizes how much can be done with a little effort.  Practical solutions for everyday problems.  Classic Franklin.  Even muses about shaving.</Person2>
<Person1>Little advantages make life happier, he says.  Then he becomes postmaster-general, along with William Hunter.  Turns the American office profitable, triples the revenue.  Quite the turnaround!</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? Until the ministers mess it up.  And he gets honorary degrees from Harvard and Yale! Recognized for his scientific work, even without a formal education.  Amazing!  And then, the Albany Plan of Union.</Person2>
<Person1>Trying to unite the colonies, under one government.  Presents his plan, it gets approved by the congress, but rejected by both the colonies and England.  Too much prerogative, too much democracy.  Go figure.</Person1>
<Person2>He thinks it was the perfect middle ground.  Would've prevented the whole war, he says. And then, the quarrels with the proprietary governors.  Hamilton, then Morris. Always fighting with the Assembly.</Person2>
<Person1>Morris promises to avoid disputes, but can't resist.  Loves to argue. Franklin gets dragged into it, writing the Assembly's responses. But they remain friends, even dine together.  That anecdote about Sancho Panza and selling the Quakers is pretty funny.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? "The governor hasn't blacked them enough yet," Franklin quips.  And the root of the problem? The proprietaries. Refusing to pay taxes for defense. Incredibly cheap, Franklin calls them.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's back from the frontier, right?  Dealing with, um, proprietary governors again. This time, it's Denny.</Person1>
<Person2>Denny, yeah.  Starts off all friendly, promises support, wants a good relationship.  But then?</Person2>
<Person1>Same old story.  Instructions from the proprietaries, conflicts with the Assembly. Franklin's right back in the thick of it, writing responses, defending the Assembly's position.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  So, no personal animosity between them, despite the political battles?</Person2>
<Person1>Surprisingly, no! They actually get along, have conversations, even dine together. Franklin even tells this funny story about Sancho Panza and the Quakers.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah? What's that about?</Person2>
<Person1>It's a joke about how the governor hasn't, uh, "blackened" the Quakers enough yet, hasn't made them suffer enough.  Shows how they could still be civil, even while disagreeing.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, interesting.  So, the Assembly decides to petition the king directly, right?  And Franklin's chosen as their agent to go to England.</Person2>
<Person1>Exactly! But then Lord Loudoun arrives, wants to mediate.  Big meeting, lots of discussion, but no real resolution.  Loudoun pressures the Assembly to comply, even threatens to withhold troops for the frontier defense.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh? That's harsh! So, they give in?</Person2>
<Person1>Reluctantly.  They draft a new bill, following the proprietary instructions, just to get things moving.  Franklin's finally free to sail, but his ship's already left with his supplies!   Loudoun gets all the credit for the supposed "accommodation," too.</Person1>
<Person2>That's rough!  Talk about adding insult to injury.  So, what's the deal with Lord Loudoun? Seems like a, a real piece of work.</Person2>
<Person1>Well, he's indecisive, keeps delaying the packets. Franklin's stuck in New York for weeks, even months, waiting for him to get his act together.  He's always writing, but never seems to finish anything.  Like that St. George on the signs, always on horseback, never riding on.</Person1>
<Person2>Ha!  I see.  So, Loudoun finally sails, takes Franklin along, but then detours to Halifax for these pointless sham attacks. Brings everyone back to New York, after wasting months and resources!  Unbelievable!</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, a total mess. And while he's gallivanting around, the French and natives take Fort George!  Loudoun even messes up the embargo, causing huge losses to the Carolina fleet.  Talk about incompetence!</Person1>
<Person2>Wow. Just wow.  And Franklin's trying to get reimbursed for the supplies he provided to Braddock, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah, but Loudoun keeps putting him off.  Then accuses him of lining his pockets!  Says everyone involved in supplying the army finds ways to enrich themselves.  Franklin insists he hasn't taken a penny, but Loudoun doesn't believe him.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, cynical much?  So, Franklin finally gets to England, right?  After all that drama.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Franklin's in England, finally! After all that rigmarole with Loudoun, the delayed packets, the sham attacks...it's a wonder he ever made it.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, what a mess! But now he's there to represent the Assembly, petition the King...hopefully things will go smoother from now on, um, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, not exactly. He runs into some, uh, resistance from the Proprietaries, particularly their secretary, Paris.  Seems there's some bad blood between them.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh?  What happened?</Person2>
<Person1>Franklin had, you know, criticized some of Paris's papers, called them weak and haughty. Paris, being a proud guy, takes offense, holds a grudge.</Person1>
<Person2>I see.  So, this personal animosity spills over into their official dealings?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally.  The Proprietaries, on Paris's advice, get the Attorney and Solicitor-General involved, delay things for almost a year!  Franklin keeps asking for a response, but they keep stonewalling him.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, man!  Bureaucracy at its finest.  What's their excuse?</Person2>
<Person1>They claim Franklin's paper lacks formality, call it rude. Probably because he didn't use their fancy titles, "True and Absolute Proprietaries," and all that.</Person1>
<Person2>Ha!  Petty much? So, what's the big issue, anyway? What are they fighting about?</Person2>
<Person1>Taxing the proprietary estate.  The Assembly wants to tax everyone equally, including the Proprietaries, but they resist. They claim it'll ruin them, that the assessors will be biased.</Person1>
<Person2>Oh, I see.  So, it goes to court?</Person2>
<Person1>Yup.  Lawyers on both sides, arguing back and forth. Franklin insists the assessors are honest, that the tax is fair. The Proprietaries claim it's all a scheme to burden them and spare the people.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, classic power struggle.  And Franklin? What's his strategy?</Person2>
<Person1>He makes this bold move!  Lord Mansfield, one of the Proprietaries' lawyers, pulls him aside, asks if he really believes the estate won't be harmed. Franklin says absolutely, and offers to guarantee it!</Person1>
<Person2>Wow! That's putting your money where your mouth is.  So, they take him up on it?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally!  Paris agrees, they draw up a paper, Franklin signs it, and the law passes! Talk about a turning point.</Person1>
<Person2>Incredible! And the Proprietaries? They're furious, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Oh, yeah. They fire Governor Denny for passing the act in the first place, threaten to sue him. But Denny has friends in high places, so nothing comes of it.</Person1>
<Person2>Hmm, poetic justice, maybe.  And Franklin?  He's a hero, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Totally!  The Assembly thanks him, praises him for securing the credit of the paper money.  A real victory for the people.</Person1>
<Person2>So, from runaway apprentice to international diplomat, fighting for his colony, outsmarting powerful lords and lawyersâ€¦what a story! What an incredible journey! Itâ€™s been a pleasure discussing Benjamin Franklinâ€™s fascinating autobiography with you all.</Person2>
